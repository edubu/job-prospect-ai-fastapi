Below are links that were found on the main page of {url}:
----------------------------------------
{links}
----------------------------------------
Please choose a few links that you think are most important to discover more about what the company does. Include a few that give information on their products, along with a few that tell more about the company.
For examples:
- I may choose 4 links that have /solutions in the title so that I can learn more about their products.
- I may choose 2 links that have /about or /who-we-are in the title so that I can learn more about the company.
- I may choose 2 links that have /careers in the title so that I can learn more about the company culture.
I want to avoid choosing links that seem to be about a product that is not relevant to what the website is about. For example,
If the website is an ecommerce store, I do not want to scrape product descriptions as they do not give much information about the website
Give a list of only the ones that seem most important. Return a maximum of ${num_links} links.
